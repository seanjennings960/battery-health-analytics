# Product Context â€” battery-health-analytics

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Battery degradation is a critical but poorly understood factor in energy storage systems. Current challenges:

- **Lack of visibility**: Battery health degrades silently until catastrophic failure
- **Suboptimal usage**: Without understanding degradation patterns, systems use batteries inefficiently
- **Economic impact**: Premature battery replacement due to poor health estimation
- **Safety concerns**: Degraded batteries pose thermal runaway risks

### Market Gap
- Existing solutions are either too complex (full electrochemical models) or too simplistic (cycle counting)
- No accessible toolkit for battery engineers to quickly prototype SoH estimation pipelines
- Limited tools for evaluating how different usage patterns impact battery lifetime

## Target Users & Use Cases

### Primary Users
1. **Battery Engineers** - Need to understand degradation mechanisms and validate models
2. **Data Scientists** - Require clean pipelines for SoH estimation with proper validation
3. **Product Managers** - Want to understand trade-offs between performance and battery life
4. **Hiring Teams** - Evaluating candidates' ability to build production-ready analytics

### User Journeys

#### Battery Engineer
1. Import battery cycling data from standard datasets
2. Extract features from charge/discharge curves
3. Fit degradation models and validate against physics constraints
4. Generate reports showing model performance and residual analysis
5. Explore "what-if" scenarios for different usage patterns

#### Data Scientist
1. Access clean, leakage-free data splits for model training
2. Use validated feature extraction pipelines
3. Benchmark multiple degradation models
4. Evaluate model performance with proper statistical tests
5. Deploy models with confidence intervals

## Product Vision

### Core Value Proposition
**"From raw battery data to actionable insights in minutes, not months"**

A toolkit that makes battery health analytics:
- **Accessible**: Simple API, minimal setup
- **Reliable**: Built-in leakage prevention and physics constraints
- **Transparent**: Clear model diagnostics and uncertainty quantification
- **Actionable**: Direct connection between usage patterns and degradation

### Success Metrics
- **Time to insight**: < 30 minutes from data to first SoH estimate
- **Model reliability**: Residuals pass statistical whiteness tests
- **User adoption**: Clean enough for hiring portfolio, practical enough for real use
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new models and datasets

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity First
- **Minimal boilerplate**: Core functionality in <10 lines of code

### Transparency & Trust
- **Explainable models**: Clear equations and parameter interpretations
- **Diagnostic tools**: Residual plots, statistical tests, uncertainty bands
- **Reproducible results**: Fixed seeds, deterministic pipelines

### Visual Clarity
