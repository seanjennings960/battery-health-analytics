## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Initialization (Current Task)
**Status**: In Progress
- Creating comprehensive memory bank structure for Cline
- Documenting project context, technical patterns, and current state
- Establishing foundation for future development work

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank initialization with `progress.md`
2. Assess existing codebase structure and alignment with project brief
3. Identify gaps between current implementation and target architecture
4. Plan refactoring strategy for package structure consistency

## Recent Changes & Discoveries

### Existing Codebase Analysis
**Current Package Structure**: `src/battery_health/multi_aging_exp/`
- `feature_extraction.py`: Existing feature extraction implementation
- `data_import.py`: Data loading and preprocessing utilities
- **Gap**: Current structure doesn't match project brief's proposed `src/bha/` structure

**Project Brief vs Reality**:
- **Proposed**: Clean `src/bha/` with `features.py`, `models.py`, `metrics.py`, etc.
- **Current**: `src/battery_health/multi_aging_exp/` with different organization
- **Decision needed**: Refactor to match brief or adapt brief to current structure

### Memory Bank Structure Established
Created comprehensive documentation:
- ‚úÖ `projectbrief.md`: Complete project specification
- ‚úÖ `productContext.md`: User needs and product vision
- ‚úÖ `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns
- ‚úÖ `techContext.md`: Technology stack and development setup
- üîÑ `activeContext.md`: Current work (this file)
- ‚è≥ `progress.md`: Status and next steps (pending)

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Package Structure Decision
**Current Dilemma**: 
- Project brief specifies `src/bha/` package structure
- Existing code uses `src/battery_health/multi_aging_exp/`
- Need to decide: refactor existing code or adapt brief

**Recommendation**: 
- Keep existing `battery_health` package name (more descriptive)
- Reorganize modules to match brief's functional organization
- Create clean module boundaries: `features.py`, `models.py`, `metrics.py`, etc.

### Development Priorities
1. **Code Organization**: Align existing code with architectural patterns
2. **Testing Framework**: Establish comprehensive test suite
3. **Data Pipeline**: Implement leakage-safe validation splits
4. **Model Implementation**: Add literature-standard degradation models
5. **Dashboard**: Create minimal SvelteKit visualization

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style Preferences (from project brief)
- **Functional programming**: Pure functions, minimal side effects
- **Type safety**: Full type hints, pydantic data models
- **Minimal boilerplate**: Clean, concise APIs
- **Grammar of graphics**: Vega-Lite over imperative plotting
- **Physics constraints**: Built-in SoH bounds and monotonicity

### Critical Requirements
- **No data leakage**: Strict time-based validation splits
- **Statistical rigor**: Residual whiteness tests, proper validation
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed seeds, deterministic pipelines
- **Performance**: <1s feature extraction, <30s model fitting

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Technical Insights
1. **Leakage prevention is first-class**: Not an afterthought, but core to architecture
2. **Physics constraints matter**: SoH must be bounded and monotonic
3. **Statistical validation required**: Ljung-Box tests, residual analysis
4. **Visualization philosophy**: Declarative > imperative charts

### User Experience Insights
1. **Target audience**: Battery engineers + data scientists + hiring teams
2. **Success metric**: "30 minutes from data to first SoH estimate"
3. **Quality bar**: Production-ready code suitable for hiring portfolio
4. **Scope discipline**: Avoid feature creep, focus on core objectives

### Development Philosophy
1. **Shipping-oriented**: Practical, deployable solutions over academic exercises
2. **Test-driven**: Comprehensive testing including property-based tests
3. **Documentation-first**: Clear equations, units, and examples
4. **Incremental**: Build MVP first, then extend

## Current Blockers & Risks

### Technical Risks
- **Package structure inconsistency**: Need to resolve naming/organization
- **Data availability**: Need to verify access to MIT/HUST/TJU/XJTU datasets
- **Performance requirements**: Ensure algorithms meet speed constraints
- **Visualization complexity**: Keep Vega-Lite charts focused and simple

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Temptation to add advanced ML features
- **Over-engineering**: Balance between clean code and shipping quickly
- **Data leakage**: Easy to accidentally introduce temporal leakage
- **Statistical validity**: Proper validation requires domain expertise

## Context for Future Sessions

### What Cline Should Know
1. **Memory bank is primary source of truth**: Always read all memory bank files first
2. **Project brief defines scope**: Stick to three core objectives
3. **Existing code needs reorganization**: Don't start from scratch, refactor thoughtfully
4. **Quality standards are high**: This is a hiring portfolio project
5. **User preferences matter**: Functional style, type safety, grammar of graphics

### Key Files to Monitor
- `src/battery_health/multi_aging_exp/feature_extraction.py`: Current feature implementation
- `src/battery_health/multi_aging_exp/data_import.py`: Data loading utilities
- `pyproject.toml`: Dependencies and project configuration
- `README.md`: Project documentation and examples

### Success Indicators
- Tests pass with >80% coverage
- README shows benchmark plots
- Dashboard loads and displays sample data
- Code follows functional programming patterns
- No data leakage in validation splits
- Models enforce physics constraints

## Communication Notes

### Developer Preferences (from project brief)
- **Background**: MS in control & power systems, self-taught batteries
- **Target role**: Voltaiq-like organizations
- **Communication style**: Practical, shipping-oriented, brief and actionable
- **Technical preferences**: Clarity over boilerplate, typed Python, declarative viz

### Tone & Approach
- Keep explanations concise and technical
- Focus on actionable next steps
- Avoid unnecessary pleasantries ("Great!", "Certainly!")
- Emphasize practical implementation over theory
- Reference specific equations and constraints when relevant
